As part of this exercise I have Implemented the Simple Auto Regressive model and Moving Average model after making the series Stationary (take lambda = 0 in the Box-Cox Transformation and 1 lag of differencing)  

Simple Auto Regressive:
Q1:  Build the Simple Auto Regressive method in the above-given Sales dataset. Make the series stationary (take lambda = 0 in the Box-Cox Transformation and 1 lag in differencing) to answer the following questions.

What is the MAPE value for AR(8)? Use the first 60 rows as train data.

Q2: Moving Average
Build the Simple Auto Regressive method in the above-given Sales dataset. Make the series Stationary (take lambda = 0 in the Box-Cox Transformation and 1 lag in differencing) to answer the following questions.

What is the MAPE value for MA(3)? Use the first 60 rows as train data.


Q3: ARMA
Implement the Auto Regressive Moving Average method after making the series stationary (take lambda = 0 in the Box-Cox Transformation and 1 lag in differencing) to answer the following questions.

What is the MAPE value for ARMA(4, 3)? Use the first 60 rows as train data.
